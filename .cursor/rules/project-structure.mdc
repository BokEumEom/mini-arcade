# Project Structure Guide

## Directory Structure
- `app/`: Main application screens and navigation
  - `(tabs)/`: Tab-based navigation screens
  - `games/`: Individual game screens
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `common/`: Shared components (Header, etc.)
  - `games/`: Game-specific components
  - `ui/`: Basic UI components
- `constants/`: Application constants and configurations
- `context/`: React Context providers
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `utils/`: Utility functions

## Key Files
- Main navigation: [app/_layout.tsx](mdc:app/_layout.tsx)
- Home screen: [app/(tabs)/index.tsx](mdc:app/(tabs)/index.tsx)
- Settings screen: [app/(tabs)/settings.tsx](mdc:app/(tabs)/settings.tsx)
- Game list: [constants/Games.ts](mdc:constants/Games.ts)
- Theme context: [context/ThemeContext.tsx](mdc:context/ThemeContext.tsx)

## Component Organization
- UI components should be placed in `components/ui/`
- Game-specific components in `components/games/`
- Shared/common components in `components/common/`
- Each component should have its own directory with index.tsx
