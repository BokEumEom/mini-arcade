# Game Implementation Guide

## Game Structure
Each game should follow this structure:
```
app/games/[game-id]/
├── index.tsx        # Main game screen
├── components/      # Game-specific components
├── hooks/          # Game-specific hooks
└── utils/          # Game-specific utilities
```

## Game Registration
Games are registered in [constants/Games.ts](mdc:constants/Games.ts):
```typescript
{
  id: 'game-id',
  title: 'Game Title',
  description: 'Game Description',
  icon: 'icon-name' as IconName
}
```

## Game Navigation
Games are accessed through the home screen:
[app/(tabs)/index.tsx](mdc:app/(tabs)/index.tsx)

## Game Components
Common game components:
- `GameCard`: [components/games/GameCard.tsx](mdc:components/games/GameCard.tsx)
- `GameLayout`: Base layout for game screens
- `GameHeader`: Game-specific header
